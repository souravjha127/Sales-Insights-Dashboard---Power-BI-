# Sales Insights Dashboard->Power-BI
This project presents an interactive and visually rich Sales Insights Dashboard built with Microsoft Power BI, aimed at uncovering key business metrics from raw sales data extracted from SQL.

The dashboard empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by providing a comprehensive view of sales performance, profit trends, and regional insights.

## Business Problem
- The company lacked a centralized analytics platform to consolidate sales and profit data from various markets.
Challenges included:
                - Limited visibility into market-wise performance
                - Inability to track profitability trends over time
                - Difficulty identifying loss-making regions and high-value customers
                - This prevented the leadership team from making timely, data-driven strategic decisions.

## Goal of the Dashboard
- Provide real-time, interactive analysis of sales and profit metrics
- Identify top and bottom-performing markets
- Track KPIs and trends to support operational and strategic planning
- Improve decision-making through clear and actionable insights
